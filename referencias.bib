The execution time of matrix multiplications can be decreased to 40.1{\%} by our method, compared with using the fastest of either CPU only case or GPU only case. Our method performs well when matrix sizes are large.",

abstract="The phrase model checking refers to algorithms for exploring the state space of a transition system to determine if it obeys a specification of its intended behavior. These algorithms can perform exhaustive verification in a highly automatic manner, and, thus, have attracted much interest in industry. Model checking programs are now being commercially marketed. However, model checking has been held back by the state explosion problem, which is the problem that the number of states in a system grows exponentially in the number of system components. Much research has been devoted to ameliorating this problem.",

Efficient formulations of the model checking problem for SMT solvers are evaluated, and the performance{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}of different solvers compared. Finally a number of optimisations for concurrent program verification not previously applied to symbolic software model checking are evaluated, resulting in an order of magnitude performance improvement over ESBMCs prior and already internationally{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}competitive performance.}
